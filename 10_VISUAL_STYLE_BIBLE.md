### **COLOR SYMBOLISM**

**Blue + Green = Purple:**
When Romeo and Julienne are together, their colors mix to create purple light. This is the visual representation of their love—synthesis, unity, transcendence.

**Desaturation = Death:**
When characters die, their colors fade to grayscale. Romeo's blue fades to gray. Julienne's green fades to gray. Only together in death do they create a faint purple glow.

**Color Bleeding:**
As the story progresses, colors begin to bleed across faction lines:
- Green plants appear in the Machinarium
- Blue technology appears in the Verdant Depths
- Purple becomes more common
- Visual representation of change

## 📐 **DESIGN PRINCIPLES**

### **CONTRAST**
Everything is designed in contrasts:
- Blue vs. Green
- Metal vs. Organic
- Geometric vs. Curved
- Cold vs. Warm
- Logic vs. Emotion

### **SYNTHESIS**
The resolution is always synthesis:
- Purple (blue + green)
- Hybrid (metal + organic)
- Balance (geometric + curved)
- Unity (cold + warm)
- Love (logic + emotion)

### **BEAUTY IN DIVISION**
Both aesthetics are beautiful:
- Mechanite: cold, precise, awe-inspiring
- Genovore: warm, chaotic, breathtaking
- Neither is "better"—they're different

### **HOPE IN SYNTHESIS**
The Hybrid aesthetic is the most beautiful:
- Combines the best of both
- Shows what could be
- Represents the future
