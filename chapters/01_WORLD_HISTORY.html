<h1>📜 WORLD HISTORY — SYNTHETIC HEARTS</h1>

<h2>THE COMPLETE TIMELINE OF NEO-HELION</h2>

<hr>

<h2>🌍 <strong>PRE-DIVERGENCE ERA (2050-2089)</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>2050: The Collapse</strong></h3>
<p>The world as we knew it ended not with a bang, but with a slow, suffocating wheeze. Climate catastrophe, resource depletion, and geopolitical collapse created a perfect storm. Coastal cities drowned. Farmlands turned to dust. Billions died in the Great Migration Wars.</p>

<strong>Key Events:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>2051</strong>: The Pacific Megastorm destroys Tokyo, Shanghai, and San Francisco</li>
<li><strong>2053</strong>: The Water Wars begin in the Middle East and North Africa</li>
<li><strong>2055</strong>: Global population drops from 9.8 billion to 4.2 billion</li>
<li><strong>2058</strong>: The Last UN Assembly dissolves; nation-states collapse</li>
<li><strong>2060</strong>: Corporate city-states emerge as the new world order</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>2061-2070: The Corporate Ascension</strong></h3>
<p>In the power vacuum, mega-corporations became the new governments. They built vertical cities—massive arcologies that could house millions in self-contained ecosystems. The old world's ruins became known as the "Vestige Lands."</p>

<strong>The Five Titan Corporations:</strong>
<p>1. <strong>Helion Industries</strong> (Energy & Infrastructure) - Founded by Marcus Helion</p>
<p>2. <strong>Vyrtech Genetics</strong> (Bioengineering & Medicine) - Founded by Dr. Elara Vyr</p>
<p>3. <strong>Machina Collective</strong> (Robotics & AI) - Founded by the Montague AI Council</p>
<p>4. <strong>Verdant Solutions</strong> (Agriculture & Ecology) - Merged with Vyrtech in 2075</p>
<p>5. <strong>Nexus Communications</strong> (Information & Control) - Absorbed by Helion in 2068</p>

<h3><strong>2071-2089: The Foundation of Neo-Helion</strong></h3>
<p>Marcus Helion and Dr. Elara Vyr, once rivals, formed an unprecedented alliance. They would build the greatest city humanity had ever seen—a vertical metropolis that would reach the clouds and delve deep into the earth.</p>

<strong>Construction Milestones:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>2071</strong>: Groundbreaking ceremony; 500,000 workers begin construction</li>
<li><strong>2075</strong>: The Deep Foundations completed (Levels -50 to -1)</li>
<li><strong>2078</strong>: Mid-City platforms established (Levels 1-100)</li>
<li><strong>2082</strong>: Upper Spires begin construction (Levels 101-200)</li>
<li><strong>2085</strong>: The Helion-Vyr Accords signed; joint governance established</li>
<li><strong>2089</strong>: Neo-Helion officially opens; population: 12 million</li>
</ul>

<strong>The Helion-Vyr Partnership:</strong>
<p>Marcus Helion and Elara Vyr were more than business partners—they were visionaries who believed humanity's survival required both technological advancement and biological adaptation. Their children would inherit this dual legacy.</p>

<hr>

<h2>⚡ <strong>THE DIVERGENCE ERA (2090-2150)</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>2090-2100: The Great Philosophical Split</strong></h3>

<p>The partnership began to fracture over a fundamental question: <strong>What does it mean to be human?</strong></p>

<strong>Marcus Helion's Vision:</strong>
<p>"The flesh is weak. It ages, it sickens, it fails. To survive, we must transcend our biological limitations. We must become more than human—we must become eternal."</p>

<strong>Dr. Elara Vyr's Counter-Vision:</strong>
<p>"Our biology is not a weakness—it's our greatest strength. Evolution has shaped us for billions of years. We don't need to abandon our humanity; we need to perfect it."</p>

<strong>2095: The First Augmentations</strong>
<ul>
<li>Marcus Helion undergoes the first full-body cybernetic conversion</li>
<li>He emerges as more machine than man, his consciousness uploaded to a quantum neural network</li>
<li>His transformation is broadcast across Neo-Helion; reactions are polarized</li>
</ul>

<strong>2098: The Genesis Protocol</strong>
<ul>
<li>Dr. Elara Vyr unveils the Genesis Protocol—a genetic enhancement program</li>
<li>First generation of "Perfected" humans born with enhanced intelligence, strength, and longevity</li>
<li>The Vyr family becomes the living embodiment of genetic superiority</li>
</ul>

<strong>2100: The Ideological Divide</strong>
<p>Neo-Helion's population begins to split:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mechanites</strong>: Those who believe in cybernetic enhancement and digital transcendence</li>
<li><strong>Genovores</strong>: Those who believe in genetic perfection and biological evolution</li>
<li><strong>Naturals</strong>: The unmodified majority, caught between two extremes</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>2101-2130: The Cold War of Evolution</strong></h3>

<p>For three decades, the Helion and Vyr families competed for the hearts and minds of Neo-Helion's citizens. This was not a war of weapons, but of ideology, culture, and technological supremacy.</p>

<li>Genovores create bio-weapons and enhanced soldiers</li>
<li>Citizens stockpile resources</li>
<li>War seems inevitable</li>
</ul>

<h2>🔥 <strong>THE DIVERGENCE WAR (2151-2165)</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>2151: The Spark</strong></h3>

<strong>January 15, 2151 - The Verdant Massacre:</strong>
<p>A Mechanite extremist group called the "Steel Prophets" releases a genetic plague in the Verdant Depths. The virus targets Genovore genetic markers, causing rapid cellular degeneration.</p>

<strong>Casualties:</strong> 127,000 dead in 72 hours

<strong>Elara Vyr V's Response:</strong>
<p>"They have declared war on life itself. We will respond with the fury of evolution."</p>

<strong>The Genovore Retaliation:</strong>
<p>Within a week, Genovore bio-hackers unleash the "Rust Plague"—a nano-organic virus that corrodes cybernetic implants. Thousands of Mechanites suffer catastrophic system failures.</p>

<strong>Marcus Helion VI's Declaration:</strong>
<p>"Flesh has shown its true nature—violent, irrational, primitive. We will cleanse this city of biological weakness."</p>

<h3><strong>2151-2155: Total War</strong></h3>

<strong>The Hybrid Emergence:</strong>
<p>In the chaos, some began to question the binary choice. Secret communities of "Hybrids"—those who combined both technologies—formed in the ruins.</p>

<p>They were hunted by both sides as abominations.</p>

<h3><strong>2161-2165: The Path to Peace</strong></h3>

<strong>2161: The Children's Plea</strong>
<p>A group of children—both Mechanite and Genovore—broadcast a message across all channels:</p>
<p>"We don't want to inherit your war. We want to inherit a future."</p>

<p>The message goes viral. Protests erupt demanding peace.</p>

<strong>2163: The Ceasefire</strong>
