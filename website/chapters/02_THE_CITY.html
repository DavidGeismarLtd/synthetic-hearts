<h1>🏙️ THE CITY — NEO-HELION</h1>

<h2>THE VERTICAL METROPOLIS</h2>

<hr>

<h2>🌆 <strong>OVERVIEW</strong></h2>

<strong>Neo-Helion</strong> is not just a city—it's a monument to human ambition and hubris. A vertical megacity that stretches from 50 levels below ground to 200 levels above, housing 18.5 million souls in a space that defies conventional urban planning.

<strong>Dimensions:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Height</strong>: 4.2 kilometers (from deepest level to highest spire)</li>
<li><strong>Footprint</strong>: 85 square kilometers</li>
<li><strong>Population Density</strong>: 217,647 people per square kilometer</li>
<li><strong>Levels</strong>: 250 total (50 below ground, 200 above)</li>
<li><strong>Construction Time</strong>: 18 years (2071-2089)</li>
<li><strong>Age</strong>: 158 years old (as of 2247)</li>
</ul>

<strong>Architectural Philosophy:</strong>
<p>Neo-Helion was designed as a self-contained ecosystem—a city that could survive even if the outside world died completely. Every level serves a purpose. Every district has a function. Nothing is wasted.</p>

<p>But the war changed everything. What was once unified is now divided. What was once harmonious is now hostile.</p>

<strong>Levels 150-200 | Altitude: 3,000m - 4,200m | Population: 2.1 million</strong>

<h4><strong>Description:</strong></h4>
<p>The crown of Neo-Helion. A realm of chrome and circuitry, where the sky is always visible through transparent aluminum domes. The Machinarium is the Mechanite heartland—a place where flesh is considered a temporary inconvenience and consciousness is currency.</p>

<h4><strong>Architecture:</strong></h4>

<p>Children are augmented from birth—neural implants at age 1, limb replacements at age 5, full conversion by age 18.</p>

<h4><strong>Atmosphere:</strong></h4>
<p>Cold. Clinical. Precise. The air is filtered and temperature-controlled to optimal levels. Rain never falls here—the domes keep it out. At night, the city glows with a million blue lights, like a circuit board come to life.</p>

<p>Vestige Ring residents are the working class of Neo-Helion. They maintain the infrastructure, run the shops, and keep the city functioning. Many work for both factions, crossing borders daily. Life is harder here, but freer.</p>

<p>Families are diverse—some Natural, some with minor modifications, some mixed. The Ring is where the old world still lives.</p>

<h4><strong>Atmosphere:</strong></h4>
<p>Chaotic. Vibrant. Real. The air quality varies wildly by level. Sunlight penetrates through gaps in the upper levels, creating shafts of light in the gloom. The smell is a mix of cooking food, machine oil, and humanity.</p>

<p>This is where Neo-Helion's soul lives—messy, complicated, and beautifully human.</p>
